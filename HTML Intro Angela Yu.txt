--> Heading Elements

<Tag> vs Element

- Tag is enclosed within the angle brackets
- Element is the content along with the opening and closing tags	

// Heading tags
<h1> </h1>

//Element
<h1>Hello There</h1>

Based on hierarchy,
there are different levels of heading tags in HTML h1 to h6
<h1>Heading 1</h1> // Biggest
<h1>Heading 2</h2>
<h1>Heading 3</h3>
<h1>Heading 4</h4>
<h1>Heading 5</h5>
<h1>Heading 1</h6> // Smallest



--> Paragraph Elements

<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>


--> Self Closing Elements

void element is an element where you are forbidden to enter any content inside the tags
Forward slash is just before the end of the tag

Horizantal Rule Element
it is just a horizantal line. used to seperate pararaphs
usually used between paragraphs.
<hr/> or <hr> is acceptable from html5


Break Element

Ex: usually in the same paragraph but to differenciate, we use a break element. Functions like 'enter'

<br/> or <br> is acceptable from html5
