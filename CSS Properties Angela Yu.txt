--> Color Properties

	Previous Ex:
	html{
		background-color:red;
	}

	h1{
		color:blue;
	}


There are Named Colors. Name of a color 

Each will have a RGB hex value or hex codes

	Ex Syntax:

	color: red;
	color: orange;

For 3rd party color palettes, some tools available are-  color hunt, RGB mixer


this hex code is formed by mixing rgb colors out of 255 
rgb(93,56,145) 
'converting that rgb from decimal to hex code gives something like #5D3891 
which is called hex or hexadecimal code

	h1{
		color: #5D3891;
	}

	---> Font Properties


	h1{
		color: blue;
		font-size: 20px;
		font-weight: bold;
		font-family: sans-serif;
	}

--> Font Size:

	h1{
		font-size: 20px;
	}

//1px is 1/96th inch; 1X1 cube
//1 px is pexel 1/96th inch  0.26mm
//1 pt is a point 1/72nd inch 0.35mm Ex: in ms word, if we specify size 12, it means 12 pt
//1 em 100% of parent. relative size. 2 em means 2times the size of parent
//1 rem 100% of root.  relative to the root of the HTML file. root is HTML element
 rem - more consistent way of changing  font size, recommended

diff b/w em and rem:

Also available are named font size
xx-large, large etc



--> Font Weight:
	generally normal or bold are the basic keywords

	h1{
		font-weight: bold;
	}

	normal bold: keywords

	lighter: Relative to parent
	bolder: Relative to parent

	number: 100-900 //lighter or bolder, lower - lighter, higher - bolder



-->Font Family

	h1{
		font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif // typeface, backup generic font type
	}


//back up is taken when the main font is not available
// sans serif is all edges at right angle, decorating edges etc are all serif type font
//Times new roman is serif

// in the font family if we have multiple words
// then, it needs to be embedded in double quotes

	Ex:

	h2{
		font-family: "Times New Roman",serif
	}

	Best places to find free fons is https://fonts.google.com/
	

--> Text Align

	Ex:
	h1{
		text-align:center; 
	}


--> The Box Model
Margin, Padding and Border
Each element is a box
we can change the dimensions by changing width nd height

--> 
height:600px;
if we increase the height the other elements will be pushed down

--> 
width: 600px;
or
width: 100%;  // this means it can occupy 100% of the screen
we change the box dimensions using pixels or we can use "%"

-->
border: 10px solid black;

// 1.thickness 2.style 3.color

	border-top:0px; // in 2nd line it will then alter after what it has rendered in the 1st line
	border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px // clockwise direction for each side of the border	top-1 left-2 bottom-3 left-4
					// 

//border of the box// it takes 3 values seperated by spaces

border: 10px solid black;


--> padding:20px; //imagine a <p> element with border inside the box, padding will push the border out by 20px on all sides
				  //be added b/w the border of <p> and the border of the box

--> margin: 10px //Margin will push any other element by 10px 
				// be added the border of the box to anyother elements around it
				
--->Content Division Element
used to group elements together
<div> Content </div>
div acts as a container to sperate from other sections
uses: we can style them differently etc...
we can put as many elements as we can between the div tags and group them

div elements are invisible and can sometmes be hard to distinguish 

use pesticide chrome extension to debug
