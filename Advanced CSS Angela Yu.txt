----> CSS Display

3 types of display Property:
Block, Inline and Inline-Block

span is set to something called inline

	Ex: two span elements are going to be on the same line until they aren't going to fit the webpage. 
	In that case, it will go the next line

-> Inline
We can't set size height or width for inline. They will default to the size of their content
inline elemnt would strech to fit that size

-> Inline-Block
block elemtn will allow us to set height and width


	.html
	<h2>Harry</h2>
	<h2>Potter</h2>


	h2{
		display: block; // this will let you occupy all the block width
	}

	h2{
		display: inline; // can't set the size but it will enable the next elemts to be inline with this
	}

	h2{
		display: inline-block; // can set the size and enable the next ele be inline with this
	}


----> CSS Float
Wrapping text using float and clear

Wrap text around another element

-> float property
Ex: img elemt and a p elemt , we have to wrap the text around the img elemt

<img />
<p></p>


style.css

img{
	float: left; //image will be on the left
}


-> clear property

footer{
	clear: left;
}

footer{
	clear: right;
}

footer{
	clear: both; //will stay clear of both left and right floats
}

at present, floar and clear are not being used much
in modern web design, only use float when ou have to wrap text around img


less complicated tools like
flexbox, grid , bootstrap etc to make these kinds of changes


----> Responsive Websites

Making websites look good on all screen sizes

inorder to do that, we need to make the website responsive 
it responds to the change in screen sizes

1. Media Queries
adding breakpoints
media query is put instead of a CSS selector
Ex:
@media (max-width: 600px){
	/* CSS for screen below or equal to 600px wide */
}

2. CSS Grid
creating 2D layouts
.grid-container{
}

3. CSS Flexbox
creating 1D layouts

dividing up the width or height based on ratios provided or percentages
.flex-container{
}

4. External Frameworks e.g. Bootstrap

bootstrap is built on top of flex-container

12 sections of the website


----> Media Queries

max-width
min-width
