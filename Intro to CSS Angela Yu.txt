 HTML is meant only for content
 
 Attach Style to HTML documents through CSS
 
 -> How to Add CSS to an HTML page
 3 ways
 
 1. Inline
  <tag style="css"/>
  
  It goes to the same line as an HTML Element. in the opening tag
	-  style attribute is globally available. Attribute has a name and they have a value.
	-  value section is where we add the CSS Code
	-  1st part is Propery, 2nd Part is Value
	-  Property:Value
  Ex: <html style="background:blue"> </html>
  
  As there are lots of HTML elemets, if we a particular style, 
  we will have to add the style to eah and every element. Pretty Tedious
  
  Not normally recommended
  Only applied to specific sections, may be during testing etc.
 1 Element 
 
 2. Internal
 <style>css</style>
 
	- This is done through a special HTML tag 
		 <style>
			html{
				background:blue;
			}
		 </style>
	- Selector goes just before curly braces and CSS code goes in b/w curly braces
	- Internal syling can be applied anywhere in the entire HTML doc 
	- and inside we can target and select as many elements we wish to 
	
	if we have a multipage website, then shouldn't use internal css styling
	 1 Webpage
 
 3. External
 <link href="style.css">
 
 
	 - Diff b/w internal and external CSS styling is - external lives in a completely seperate file.
	 - Ex: styles.css
			 html{
			 background:green;
			 }
	 
	 How to link up the style sheet file with index.html?
	 inside the head element, we add a link tag
	 
	 <head>
		<link
			rel="stylesheet"		// Relationship refers to the role of what it is we're linking to
			href="./styles.css"		// Location
		/>
	 </head>

--> CSS Selectors
Choosing where to apply CSS

property:value

Ex: color:blue

1. Element Selector
here, h1 is the selector
This is called element sector. Here, it is targeting all h1

style.css
h1{
color:blue
}

index.html
<h1>Red</h1>
<h1>Green</h1>
<h1>Blue</h1>

Here it will affect all the h1 elements


2. Class Selector
special symbol dot
Class is something we can add as an attribute to any html element. 
It is used for grouping elements
Ex1:
	.red-heading{
		color:red;
	}

	index.html
	<h1 class="red-heading">Red</h1>
	<h1>Green</h1>
	<h1>Blue</h1>

	Here, it will only change the element with matching class.

Ex2:
	.red-heading{
		color:red;
	}

	index.html
	<h2 class="red-heading">Red</h2>
	<h3>Green</h3>
	<p class="red-heading">Blue</p>

	Here, it will change the color of all elements with the class
	
3. Id Selector
Works similarly to class selector
Starts with #
	
	Ex:
	#main{
		color:red;
	}

	Ex:
		style.css
		#main{
			color:red;
		}
		
		index.html
		<h2 id="main">Red</h2>

id vs class selector:
class can be applied to many elements
id can be applied to only one element in a HTML file. 
Should be completely unique.

4. Attribute Selector
p[draggable]{
	color:red
}

We can add as many attributes as we like
id, class, draggable, href, src etc

<h1></h1>


Ex1:

p is the html element
draggable is the attribute


	p[draggable]{
		color:red
	}

	<p draggable="true">Drag me</p>         // only this will be applied 
	<p>Don't Drag me</p>
	<p>Don't Drag me</p>



	All paragraph elements with the attribute 'draggable' will be applied the css style
	

Ex2:
	We can also filter the attribues with certain value

	p[draggable="false"]{
		color:red
	}

	<p draggable="true">Drag me</p>         
	<p draggable="false">Don't Drag me</p>	// this will be applied 
	<p draggable="false">Don't Drag me</p>	// this will be applied 

5. Universal Selector
* means select all

*{
	color:red
}

This will apply to all the elements where this style sheet is active
