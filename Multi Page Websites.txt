--> Computer FilePaths

Root
	file1
	Folder1
		file2.txt
		folder2
			image1
			image2
			
			

Two types of File Paths:
1. Absolute File Path
2. Relative File Path


Absolute: path desired to get to final destination

Ex: C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Angela Yu Web Dev Course/cat.png

Even if anywhere on the computer


Relative:

-Shorter
-can move folders around
For Web Dev-- Relative file path is more useful

we are not in the root folder

to ref an image from a website

-Special Characters

../essay.docx // to go up a folder
./dog.png     // Remain in the current directory and look for the file


to access anything in the current directory
./ is recommended to use


--> Project

	<body><h1>All the Animals</h1>
	<h2>Rabbit:</h2>
	<img src="./rabbit.png" alt="rabbit image">
	<h2>Cat:</h2>
	<img src="./Folder3/cat.png" alt="cat image">
	<h2>Dog:</h2>
	<img src="../dog.png" alt="dog image">
	<h2>Fish:</h2>
	<img src="../Folder1/fish.png" alt="fish image">
	<h2>Bird:</h2>
	<img src="../Folder1/Folder2/bird.png" alt="bird image">

--> WebPages

To help build multipage websites
>Project
	>index.html
	>Images
		>Cat.png


Multiple html pages and then embed them in a same project folder
we have to refer to them using anchor tags

<a href="./about.html">About Page</a>  


--> Project 
Onclicking an image another html page is to be displayed.
- For this, use img tag within the content of the anchor tag


	<h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
	<!-- Add an image of yourself that links to the about page -->

	<a href="./public/about.html"><img src="./assets/images/cat.png" alt="Cat Image" /></a>
	
	<hr />

	<a href="./public/contact.html">Contact Me</a>
	<!-- Add a link to your contact me page here -->


--> HTML Boiler Plate

Explians to understand the structure of the html files

	<!DOCTYPE html>				//Tells which type of version of HTML we have written our code in
	<html lang="en">			//Everything goes inside the html element, Lang is english
	<head>						//Important things that are not displayed to the user but used to render the webpage correctly
	  <meta charset="UTF-8" />	//Meta tag for character set. Makes sure that characters are being displayed correctly. Certain charsets won't allow emojis, some won't allow divisio and multiply symbols etc.
	  <title>My Website</title>	//Title of the website. Displayed in the tab bar of the browser
	</head>
	<body>						//Most of the content of the website goes. Add headings, images, anchors etc.
	  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
	</body>
	</html>
	
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />  //How to display the website when it first opens
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
  </body>
</html>

We can also create our own html elements
