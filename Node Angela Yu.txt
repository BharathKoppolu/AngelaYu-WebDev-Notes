Node JS
------------

NodeJS is a backend framework which lets our code interact 
with our harware/computer or a remote server

installation

download the latest stable version for windows/mac
installer from Node JS website

install node js

go to terminal or git bash to check if it's installed

node --version

----> npm - is Node Package Manager

it's got thousands of packages of resusable code that can be used in our project
which is written by people like you and me

we can go an browse diff packages from npm website


if we have a folder, then go ahead with npm init

fill out all that's necessary, then it will create a package.json file in our folder

for installing any packages, refer to the npm package documnetation and follow below steps
then..
npm install <package-name>

it will then go into dependencies within the package.json file
also creating anotherpackage-lock.json file // These are the dependencies of the package we installed

we can directly interact with our code from our terminal by just typing 'node'
it will then take us into the node environment
>
>

create a index.js file and write the code here using the packages

we have to require the packages
Ex:
const marvelHeroes = require("marvel-comics-characters"); // marvel-comics-characters is the package name


node index.js // this will execute the file
